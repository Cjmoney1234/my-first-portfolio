            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Hello!</strong><br><br> My name is Jeff Zulma. I am currently an Accountant at a wholesale distribution company who is in the transition to going public by the end of 2022, which is really an exciting journey to be a part of!<br><br>
                        This is my portfolio of a combination of past, present, and future projects; as well as my bootcamp projects that is steering my way towards a future in technology. <br>
                        My fasination in technology grew since I began working as a full-time accountant. Although it is quite dificult to manage both my day job and the bootcamp I am certain that this is what I want
                        to do. I plan to use skills I learned from working as an accountant and my time in bootcamp to land me a fufiling position not just financially but emotinally. <br><br> During my time 
                        in the bootcamp I plan to update my portfolio often, thank you! <br><br>
